        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour ¼ cup oil into the wok over medium heat and add the chilis. Let the peppers infuse the oil for 1 minute. Add the minced ginger and Sichuan peppercorn powder, if using, and fry for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Then add the ground pork. Stir until just cooked through, breaking up any big chunks. Next, add 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, ½ teaspoon of sugar, ½ teaspoon white pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and ½ teaspoon sesame oil. Then add 2 heaping tablespoons of the black bean hot sauce. Stir and cook for a minute.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat up to high and add the cooked spaghetti, peanuts, scallions, and leafy veggies. Quickly stir fry for a few minutes to heat them through. Stir fry to combine, moving quickly so the spaghetti doesn’t stick to the wok. Cook until the veggies are wilted/just cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
